## Overview
I used this challenge as a way to put into practice all that I have been learning since I started learning React.

### The challenge

It was really a fun challenge as I could see a real case of using what I've been learning. I was able to implement all the features required by the challenge which are listed below, but I still think there are more better ways to write the code. But, oh well, can't get it all right at once.

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### What I learned

I learnt how to use and implement the amazing things that comes with working with react, such as separating my UI into components, using JSX, writing javascript in between JSX, using states, e.t.c



### Continued development

I'm going to continue my react journey by learn more concepts about it and building projects along.
